Tools/playground for analyzing Chinese text for immersion learning.

Ideas:
- Tokenizer
- Tracking
- Scraping of reading sources


Notes:
- Started with a basic greedy algo
- Custom format for dictionary? - Probably overdesign


Tokenization reference

Immediate TODO:
Improve accuracy of tokenizer with some grammar
Better jsx-like option for html. (research axum more) Not really worth doing manually
